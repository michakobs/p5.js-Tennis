# p5.js-Tennis

A little retro-style Tennis game using JS and the P5 library to test the capabilities for Data-visualization.

The game is also useful to kill some time with a friend. 

Player 1 uses the keys W and S for UP and DOWN.

Player 2 uses the keys P and L for UP and DOWN.

The SPACE-key is the Kick-Off key for both.

PS: If you move your player-rectangle while hitting the ball then you can give the ball a spin.
